Updates

//Had moved the @id from user model to user, but later just added a user Id to the sql table. Now Get All user works, and get by ID works.
//Alsos in order to post or create user, you must post in json, not raw text. if raw it will give you mediatype error.
//Put method works well, all tested with post man.

//Fixed the update by user, it was missing snapshot on the init
// From angular it updates properlty
